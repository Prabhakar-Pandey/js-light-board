# js-light-board

Basic requirement to run the project on your machine.
NodeJS: As the project is developed on node js so please install node js on your machine if it is not there
Two Browser -- required for testing

How to run the project on your local machine

1. download the project on your machine.
2. run "npm install" -- to install all the dependency (express,ejs,socket.io)
3. open browser and type "localhost:5000" -- port is configurable right now it is running on port 5000.
4. open another browser to play the game simultaniusly -- as we are using local storage so opening two tabs will not work.
