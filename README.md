Basic requirement to run the project on your machine.<br/>
NodeJS: As the project is developed on node js so please install node js on your machine if it is not there<br/>
Two Browser -- required for testing<br/>
<br/>
How to run the project on your local machine
<br/>
1. download the project on your machine.<br/>
2. run "npm install" -- to install all the dependency (express,ejs,socket.io)<br/>
3. open browser and type "localhost:5000" -- port is configurable right now it is running on port 5000.<br/>
4. open another browser to play the game simultaniusly -- as we are using local storage so opening two tabs will not work.<br/>
